#### By **JOFLIX OOKO OWUOR**
## Description
This portfolio contains my personal info, my experience, and and some of the projects I have worked on.
On the landing page is a sidebar vertically on the left hand side for navigation on clicking the buttons.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* git clone https://github.com/JOFLIX/my-potfolio.git
* cd my-potfolio
* open index.html from a browser

## Known Bugs
The social media icons on the footer may not be visible, but you can scroll the page downwards and find it downwards.
They don't link to anywher, reason being the desire to preserve the privacy and integrity of my work, and at the very time increase the aesthetic value of the page. Looking foreward to implement this changes....
